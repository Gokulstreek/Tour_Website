This project is a basic tourist website built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It showcases popular travel destinations with a clean and responsive design. The homepage includes a hero section with attractive images, a navigation bar, and destination highlights using Bootstrap cards. The layout adjusts well across different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly. Custom CSS is used to enhance the visual style, and Bootstrap components help with structure and responsiveness. All files are organized into folders for easy access, including separate folders for CSS, images, and optional JavaScript. This project is ideal for practicing frontend development and learning how to build visually appealing websites.
